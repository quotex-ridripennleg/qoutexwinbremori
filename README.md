## The Platform

Quotex is a platform for trading digital options on a wide variety of
underlying assets (over 400). The term digital option refers to trades
based on simple up and down price movement with predetermined costs and
fixed outcomes.

There is no download required, the platform is completely web-based.

The platform supports trading of options on securities (companies),
forex, commodities, and some indices like the S&P 500.

The expiry durations are fairly diverse as well with 1 minute, 2
minutes, 5 minutes, one hour, and on up to a month or more in some
cases.

### Payouts

The payout percentage varies based on the asset, and time frame.

Returns will also vary on existing trade information, for example if a
large proportion of traders are all speculating in the same direction,
the payout is likely to reduce for new positions -- conversely, those
taking the contrarian view are likely to see a larger than expected
payout %.

### Education

The best method to learn the system is to utilise the demo account (more
on that below). In addition however, Quotex does provide guidance videos
and market news.

Trading signals are also offered, but these only become available on the
full account -- they cannot be accessed on the demo version.

## Mobile App

In addition to the desktop platform, Quotex also deliver an android
based trading app.

The app is quick, responsive and user friendly. It offers all the
functionality of the web version, and finding markets and placing trades
follows the same process.

The app has been reasonably well received by users, with an overall
rating of 3.6\*.

One shortcoming with the mobile offering at present, is the lack of an
iOS version for iPhone / iPad users.

## Charts

The charts are quick in terms of response to market fluctuations and
highly customizable.

The platform hosts dozens of commonly used indicators that can each be
fine-tuned to a trader's personal taste.

Ordering screens are embedded to the right of the chart so making trades
is super easy.

Also included are trading signals and market news but you have to have a
live account to access them.

## The Demo Account

Quotex offers a demo account with \$10,000 in tradable funds. The demo
account allows full access to trading features but limits access to the
news, trading tips, and other proprietary information.
